    description:
      "The ongoing SEDS Earth Information Project leverages satellite data to monitor and analyze environmental changes on Earth. By utilizing advanced imagery and remote sensing, it provides insights into climate change, deforestation, and natural disasters. The project supports sustainable development through data-driven solutions for resource management and conservation, while also enhancing disaster preparedness and response. Ultimately, it aims to foster a more informed and resilient global community.",

    description:
      "Our SEDS team successfully conducted a CanSat launch as a demonstration of the entire CanSat deployment and operation process. The launch took place from the top of the ICTC building on the final day of the LOCUS event showcasing the practical implementation of Cansat and it's operation. This hands-on event showcased the capabilities of our CanSat, from its design and testing to its real-time data collection during flight. ",

    description:
      "With implementation of Aurdino Uno Rev3 as experiment model, this project investigated the effects of spaceflight on the germination and growth of holy basil seeds as participant of AHiS call for projects. By comparing the performance of seeds that have orbited in space with those that remained on Earth, the study aims to uncover how space conditions such as microgravity and radiation affect seed development and plant growth. The findings provided valuable insights into space agriculture and the potential for growing crops in future space missions.",
